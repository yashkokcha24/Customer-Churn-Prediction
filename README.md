## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a major challenge in the banking industry. Retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project aims to develop a **Machine Learning model** that predicts whether a customer will leave the bank, allowing businesses to take **proactive retention measures**.

### 🎯 **Business Problem Statement**
The goal of this project is to:

✅ Identify **customers who are likely to churn** based on transaction history and demographics.

✅ Analyze key **factors influencing churn** (e.g., credit score, tenure, and balance).

✅ Provide actionable insights for **customer retention strategies**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python   
- **Libraries & Frameworks:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting  
- **Model Deployment:** Flask API (optional)  

---

## 📊 **Dataset**
- Source: [Kaggle - Bank Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanudhakadd/bank-customer-churn-prediction)
- Features: Customer demographics, account details, and transaction patterns.
- Target Variable: **Exited (1 = Churn, 0 = Retained)**

---

## 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
🔹 **Missing Values & Outliers**: Checked for missing values and handled outliers.  
🔹 **Feature Engineering**: Encoded categorical variables using **OneHotEncoder & LabelEncoder**.  
🔹 **Data Scaling**: Standardized numerical features using **StandardScaler**.  
🔹 **Class Imbalance Handling**: Used **SMOTE** to balance churn vs. non-churn customers.

## 🤖 **Machine Learning Models & Performance**
### 📌 Models Implemented:
✔ **Logistic Regression**  
✔ **Random Forest Classifier**  
✔ **Gradient Boosting Classifier**  
✔ **Hyperparameter Tuning** (GridSearchCV)  

### 📌 Performance Metrics:

- **Accuracy**:           ✅ Evaluated overall correctness

- **Precision & Recall**: ✅ Balanced trade-off to reduce false positives
  
- **F1-Score**:           ✅ Used for imbalanced classification
  
- **ROC-AUC Curve**:      ✅ Measured model discrimination ability

## 🔥 **Key Insights & Business Value**
💡 **Top 3 Features Influencing Churn**:

1️⃣ **Credit Score** – Customers with lower scores churn more.  
2️⃣ **Tenure** – Long-term customers are more loyal.  
3️⃣ **Balance & Transactions** – Sudden fluctuations indicate risk.  

🎯 **How Businesses Can Use This Model**:
✔ Proactively **engage high-risk customers** with personalized offers.  
✔ Improve **customer satisfaction** with targeted retention strategies.  
✔ Reduce churn, leading to **higher profitability & CLV (Customer Lifetime Value)**.

## 🚀 **Future Improvements**
🔹 Deploy as a **Flask API** for real-time predictions.  
🔹 Implement **Deep Learning (ANNs)** for improved accuracy.  
🔹 Integrate with **CRM systems** for business adoption.
